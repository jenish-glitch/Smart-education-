I live in the country where people only buy the new things after it gets old, damaged and unable to function properly. So, living in Japanese culture, following the sodaigomi tradition is not of my kind. It is painful to go from the world to one in which we didn't have any household goods, couldn't bring ourselves to buy the overpriced new ones in the store – and then saw heaps of clean, new-looking merchandise just sitting on the street. By picking up items form sodaigomi, I would save a lot of money and would live a good life. So, definitely I will collect articles from sodaigomi instead of going for the new one.</div>
