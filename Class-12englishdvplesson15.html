            <div class="sub-section">
                <strong class="question">a. The writer seems to believe that rural life is better than urban life. Do you agree with him?</strong>
                <p class="answer">Yes, I agree with the writer that rural life is better than urban life. First and foremost, the tranquil surroundings and environment attract me a lot. The village is always described as a quiet and peaceful paradise, which is a perfect place to unwind and escape from the rat-race and hustle and bustle of city life. Besides, the rural areas are less crowded because there are not many people and cars. The scenery in a village is beautiful as the beauty of nature is still well-conserved. Thus, people who live in the village can enjoy nature and have a peaceful mind.</p>
                <p class="answer">This condition is completely different for city dwellers, who lead a hectic life and often feel annoyed due to the great stress in their daily lives. The environment in the rural area is less polluted. The air in the village is fresh and clean as there are plenty of undeveloped areas and greenery. In the rural area, there is less air pollution since there are not many factories and cars around. Living in the city may have its benefits such as better facilities and education. However, I am still of the opinion that living in the rural area brings more advantages than living in the city.</p>

                <strong class="question">b. Is the writer's way of looking at Bandipur just a gaze of an urban tourist? Why? Why not?</strong>
                <p class="answer">No, the writer's way of looking at Bandipur is not just a gaze of an urban tourist. He doesn't visit Bandipur merely as an urban tourist. Being fed up with his hectic life in Kathmandu, he visits there along with his friends to feel the peaceful environment and amazing beauty of the place with his heart. Bandipur is a hilltop settlement and a rural Municipality in Tanahu district of Nepal. This place is a center of attraction for various reasons. The true and original beauty of the place attracts most tourists.</p>
                <p class="answer">The amazing beauty and scenery of Bandipur also attracted the writer. In Bandipur, he and his friends are amazed by the local cultures, behaviors, and organic and delicious food items. He enjoys various places in Bandipur along with his friends. He feels himself heartily connected to this place, where he gets all sorts of refreshments he has been looking for. He learns about the places, people, and their tourism businesses. The writer spends his best time in Bandipur. Thus, his gaze towards this beautiful place is more than that of an urban tourist.</p>
