                    <div class="question">c. What are the different areas where a CV can help you?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A good CV is required when applying for jobs, seeking promotion and trying to get research funding. It helps for things such as when you're asked to be an external examiner for a course or a research thesis; for audits of teaching and research activity; if your faculty or department has to be validated by an external professional body – in short, any circumstances in which somebody needs to judge your individual professional competence or that of you and your colleagues collectively.</div>

                    <div class="question">d. What do you mean by 'staying CV' and 'leaving CV'? Which one would you develop for yourself as a freshman?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A 'staying CV' is that of the good university citizen, including plenty of committee work and administration, pastoral care of students, a heavy teaching load as well as a credible research record. A 'leaving CV' is that which reflects the interests of a prospective new employer and will probably highlight research achievements, while still showing that you are generally competent and willing across the range of duties undertaken by academics. I would develop a leaving CV for myself as a freshman.</div>

                    <div class="question">e. How can you draft a good CV?</div>
                    <div class="answer">One can draft a good CV with the help of your friends, family, mentors and more experienced colleagues. A basic framework can be used to structure your recollections and thinking. You should show your draft CV to people who know you and/or who know what an academic CV should look like and ask for feedback. In this way, you can draft a good CV.</div>

                    <div class="question">f. What is the difference between academic CV and non-academic CV?</div>
                    <div class="answer">There are two key differences between academic and non-academic CVs. One is that academic CVs tend to be quite a bit longer than those of non-academics, and they get longer as a person's career develops. A second, and perhaps more fundamental, difference is that non-academics, especially when they are seeking middle management positions, are frequently encouraged to make largely unverifiable assertions about their qualities and skills rather than to list verifiable achievements.</div>

                    <div class="question">a. CV may not represent a person's skills and abilities accurately because one's confidence cannot be rendered in a paper. What do you think the employers should do to find the best people for the job?</div>
                    <div class="answer">It's true that a CV may not represent a person's skills and abilities accurately because one's confidence cannot be rendered on paper. Employers prefer candidates who can communicate effectively. Oral and written communication is a key skill needed in almost every job. In my view, instead of judging a person's ability by a piece of paper, employers can divide the selection process into three steps. The first step is to get acquainted with the willing participants. Employers can introduce their company terms and conditions to the participants and if they think they can work under the conditions, then they can be invited for further process. The next step is a cover letter explanation. In this step, the employers should judge the person's behaviors, skills, their character and ability whether they could perform well in the company or not. The last but not the least step is calling the selected candidate to participate intelligently to join colleagues at a weekly Friday lunch where everyone "talked shop." Employees are meant to work in a team. So, a single person should not take their interview. Every person who is already in the company should get a chance to talk to them and decide whether they can work with him/her or not. These are the things the employers should do to find the best people for the job rather than focusing on a CV only.</div>

                    <div class="question">b. If employers provide job opportunities by assessing one's CV, how can fresh graduates compete with experienced competitors?</div>
                    <div class="answer">In today's competitive job market, having a degree and doing good work unfortunately may not be quite enough to land you the job. To get one step closer to your dream job, you have to stand out from the crowd and make a good impression on your potential employers. For some careers you will be required to have achieved a good degree in a specified area, however a lot of the time employers are looking for more than just a great set of exam results. They want candidates with personality and the right combination of soft skills, in areas such as interpersonal and leadership. Many fresh graduates have no idea how to write a good CV. Most use the same resume template and end up having CVs with similar format. To make yours stand out, you should break the mold and be creative. If you're applying for a creative industry, you may wish to opt for something a bit out-of-the-box or visually impressive that will really make it stand out from others. By doing this a fresh graduate can compete with experienced competitors.</div>
