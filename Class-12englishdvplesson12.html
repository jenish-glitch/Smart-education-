                    <div class="answer">The author in this essay satires on the modern idea of 'self' based on individuality, independence and uniqueness. This essay is about the self and what nature can teach us. In the beginning the writer brings an attention to the trend in humans on uplifting the feeling of self-based on individuality, independence and uniqueness. Here the author is presenting the close relationship between the nudibranch and medusa living in the Bay of Naples. A mature jellyfish engulfs a tiny newly-hatched slug only to be devoured bit by bit until the snail dominates and the jellyfish is reduced to a round "successfully edited parasite" affixed to the skin near the snail's mouth. Finally the tentacles, until the jellyfish becomes reduced in substance by being eaten while the snail grows correspondingly in size. This essay projects both creatures cannot live in any other way, they depend for their survival on each other. The author illustrates the value of co-existence, cooperation, helpfulness, collaboration and togetherness with the tale of the nudibranch and the medusa. We all are important and one's life is determined by another like the relation between anemones and crabs as well as medusa and snail. It also shows the significance of friendship and dependence on each other for survival and existence. Through this, the author justifies that the modern people's pride over the concept of individuality, independence and uniqueness is not applicable in the real and practical life.</div>

                <h3>A. Write an essay on "Independence vs. Interdependence" in about 250 words.</h3>
                <div class="writing-content">
                    <h4>Independence vs. Interdependence</h4>
                    <p>Human beings usually categorize themselves into individual or group entities. These self-conceptions usually emanate in people's minds and determine their motivation as well as cognitions. There are usually two perceptions that people have about themselves regarding their relationship with others. The first is the independent self-concept where an individual's conception about his or her existence is that he or she exists separate from other people. Independent self-concept encompasses behaviour traits, preferences and attitudes of an individual. The second perception is the interdependent self-concept where a person is affiliated or feels connected to others. This paper explores the advantages of interdependence as opposed to independence. Gish Jen argues that "the joy of a functioning interdependent relationship can be tremendous."</p>
                    <p>Unlike independent-self which focuses on individual responsibility separate from the entire society, interdependent self-concept emphasizes shared responsibilities. The main tenet of interdependence self-concept is the reliance that exists among individuals in the society for survival and mutual development. Interdependence self-instils the idea that people are not alone in their attempts at mental growth and development. People also provided support for one another to grow socially. Interdependent self-concept also promotes responsibility sharing by encouraging individuals to take various roles, which contribute to the development and growth of the society.</p>
                    <p>Interdependent self-concept is also crucial for overcoming fear. Unlike independence, which puts an individual against the rest of other members of the society, interdependence promotes cohesion among society members, thus helping individuals to experience lower levels of fear and insecurity. The recognition of the fact that one has support of others remains crucial for alleviating negative feelings, which could yield fear in individuals. Support for each other is only possible in a society where people feel close to each other and the society is characterized by high level of interdependence.</p>
                    <p>Interdependence emphasizes on how people relate with each other and get on well with existing norms of the society, which dictate how people relate. Intrinsic attributes of individuals play no major role in the way individuals think, feel or act. However, Jen also argues that "we need both the interdependent and the independent self," appealing that people from either side of self-concepts accommodates and understands each other.</p>

                    <h4>Increasing Individualism in the Modern Nepali Society</h4>
                    <p><strong>By Ramesh Thapa</strong><br>March 12, 2019</p>
                    <p>Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology and social outlook that emphasizes the intrinsic worth of the individual. Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires and to value independence and self-reliance and advocate that interests of the individual should achieve precedence over the state or a social group while opposing external interference upon one's own interests by society or institutions such as the government. Individualism is often defined in contrast to totalitarianism, collectivism and more corporate social forms.</p>
                    <p>In the modern Nepalese society, individualism is increasing rapidly. This increase appears to be due mostly to increasing socio-economic development, including higher incomes, more education, urbanization, and a shift toward white-collar jobs. Increases in these factors in a given region are reliably followed by gains in individualist beliefs and practices in the ensuing decade Nepal comes under those few countries that bucked the global trend toward individualism.</p>
                    <p>Rising prosperity and education are largely welcome changes that reflect not merely gains in wealth for the already-wealthy, but for the desperately poor as well. Wealth, and the individualism that follows, are often conflated with selfishness. This is, in part, because individualism's inverse -- collectivism -- emphasizes close social ties and an interconnected rather than independent view of the self.</p>
