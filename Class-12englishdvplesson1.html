        <h3>b. According to Josh Lanyon, "If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity." Justify this statement with your logic.</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Josh Lanyon's statement somewhat reflects the core idea behind the development of human skills on this planet. He has presented a fact related to the skills of people. Lanyon connected life skills with the ability to think with critical objectivity.</p>
            <p>From ancient times until now, people have been developing skills and inventing things. This development was possible because of their ability to think with critical objectivity, which works alongside their life skills, whether they know it or not.</p>
            <p>Critical objectivity and life skills always go hand-in-hand. People have applied various life skills in their lives, which means they can think with critical objectivity. The ability to think with critical objectivity is always present behind all these life skills.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="email-body">
                <p>Dear Shristi,</p>
                <p>I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am doing pretty well here. I am writing to you to share my experience of my English classes.</p>
                <p>Compared to any other classes I have taken during my school history, I feel that no other class could give me so much joy, knowledge, and pleasure as English class did. I learned it quite well and, in every test, I got the best marks in the class. I not only learned a lot of basic English knowledge in my middle school but also developed personal characteristics that guided my interests throughout my later education.</p>
                <p>When I was in middle school, it used to be a great thing to know that there would be an English class tomorrow morning because I could enjoy another interesting 45 minutes during the class. Unlike other classes, such as Science, Nepali, or Mathematics, I even established my English-related interest group on social media, which gave me great benefits in my university studies. I believe no other class has inspired me so far to pursue a scientific result.</p>
                <p>Another important thing I achieved through English class is the ability to collaborate with other students. I think it certainly formed my teamwork spirit, which I later used when I entered a career as an engineer. I can still clearly remember my primary and high school English teachers. They were all people of great patience and had an instructive nature. They told me not to quit when I failed again and again. They gave me a lot of confidence and mental discipline towards success. I would like to end this email by saying that English class is the only class I used to enjoy the most.</p>
                <p>Regards,<br>Binod Kumar</p>
