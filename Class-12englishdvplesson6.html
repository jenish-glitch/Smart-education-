        <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
        <h3>a. Some business houses, shops and department stores in city areas have started to adopt QR code payment systems in Nepal, too. What should be done to make it more accessible? Discuss.</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has immensely boosted the Scan and Pay service through the QR code in Nepal too. People being concerned with their hygiene are supporting the contactless payment system. Evolving digital payment service providers like Fonepay, IMEPay, Khalti, QPay, and SmartQR also encourage QR code payment by offering their users Scan and Pay services.</p>
            <p>QR code payment systems can play an impactful role in changing informal sectors into the formal economy. However, Nepal needs to tackle challenges in many infrastructural and behavioural traits before reaching the full potential of e-payment. The lack of interoperability is another major issue for a stable digital payment service. Rapid growth in several PSOs and PSPs may result in an imbalance in the ecosystem of the digital economy. To avoid this hurdle, a unified payment switch is necessary.</p>
            <p>QR code payment can be a vital factor in uplifting Nepal's digital economy. The government giving more priority to digital payment systems and the central bank to promote this system can be a head start for QR code payment.</p>
            <p>Mass awareness campaigns and promotional events can also influence this transition. Infrastructural development like high-speed internet connection and wider user accessibility must be considered. Payment service providers, payment service operators, bank and financial institutes, and traders should work together to bring interoperability to their digital payment services.</p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>It's hard but not impossible to apply Digital payment system in Nepal. Nepal needs to tackle challenges in many infrastructural and behavioural traits before reaching the full potential of e-payment. The number of internet users is impressively growing but still not enough to process an established digital economy.</p>
            <p>QR code payment systems can play an impactful role in changing informal sectors into the formal economy. The government giving more priority to digital payment systems and the central bank to promote this system can be a head start for QR code payment.</p>
            <p>Mass awareness campaigns and promotional events can also influence this transition. Infrastructural development like high-speed internet connection and wider user accessibility must be considered. Payment service providers, payment service operators, bank and financial institutes, and traders should work together to bring interoperability to their digital payment services.</p>
            <p>The ultimate goal should be offering a one-stop solution for the consumers to access all sorts of e-payment services, including QR code payment.</p>

            <h4>Digital Payment Systems in Nepal</h4>
            <p>Digital payment is gaining momentum due to social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic. The evolution of digital payment platforms and increasing consumers' preference towards e-payment secures a bright future for online payment in Nepal.</p>
            
            <h4>What is Digital Payment?</h4>
            <p>Digital Payment is definitely growing in popularity and is becoming a trend these days. The reason is simple â€“ convenience. In the era when businesses are shifting online, why not transactions!</p>
            
            <h4>Major Use of Digital Payment System in Nepal</h4>
            <p>You can find QR codes in various good and service sectors like departmental stores and small shops, and many banks and financial institutes (BFIs). You can make payments in supermarkets via a QR code scanner using a digital wallet. Local vendors and shops are also using QR codes for quick payment. Fruits and vegetable markets also feature digital payments for grocery shopping. According to a report by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the number of digital transactions from mid-December 2020 to mid-January 2021 was 372,176. Similarly, the transactional amount was Rs 1.245 billion. The next month, the number of transactions increased to 535,790 and the amount to Rs 1.712 billion, suggesting a clear rise in the use of digital payment.</p>
            
            <h4>Future and Challenges</h4>
            <p>Switching to any e-payment services like QR code will be a long-running process. PSOs like eSewa have been offering QR payment services without charging any additional fee during transactions to encourage such platforms. This generation has access to different media that can raise awareness of digital payment significance, so the numbers of users is expected to grow in the future rapidly but still not enough to process an established digital economy. The lack of interoperability is another major issue for a stable digital payment service.</p>
            
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>QR code payment can be a vital factor in uplifting Nepal's digital economy. The government giving more priority to digital payment systems and the central bank to promote this system can be a head start for QR code payment. The ultimate goal should be offering a one-stop solution for the consumers to access all sorts of e-payment services, including QR code payment.</p>
