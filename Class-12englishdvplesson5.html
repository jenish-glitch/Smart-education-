        <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
        <h3>a. APJ Abdul Kalam became a renowned aerospace scientist in his later life. Do you find any association of his childhood days in shaping his career? Explain with specific instances from the text.</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Yes, there is a strong association between Abdul Kalam's childhood days and his career as an aerospace scientist. His passion for mathematics and science was evident from an early age, as he consistently scored full marks in these subjects and spent hours solving complex number problems. The most influential moment came from his teacher, Sivasubramania Iyer, who, after finding that students didn't understand his lecture on flight dynamics, took them to the seashore for a practical demonstration. Watching the birds use their wings and tails to fly in proper balance deeply inspired Kalam. This experience determined his future path, leading him to study flight dynamics and eventually become a renowned aerospace scientist.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>b. Kalam mentions an instance of discrimination against him in his school life. What picture of society does he want to depict by mentioning the incident? Discuss.</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>By mentioning the incident of religious discrimination in his school, Kalam aims to depict a society deeply divided along religious lines. The new teacher's refusal to let Abdul, a Muslim boy, sit next to his Brahmin friend, Ramanadhan Sastry, highlights the rigid social hierarchies and prejudices of the time. This behavior, coming from an educated individual, illustrates how such discrimination was ingrained in the societal fabric. Abdul's experience of being separated from his intimate friend paints a sad picture of a society where friendship and innocence were overshadowed by religious bigotry. The incident serves as a powerful reminder of a past where people, even children, were judged not by their character but by their religious identity.</p>

        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <h3>Write a short autobiography featuring your childhood life using the following guidelines.</h3>
        <div class="autobiography-text">
            <p>I was born in a small village in the northeastern part of Nepalgunj District, into a middle-class family of five. My father is a tailor, and my mother is a loving housewife. I have an older brother and a younger sister, both of whom are also students.</p>
            <p>As a student, my daily routine revolves around studying. I usually wake up at 6:00 am to get ready for class after completing my morning routines. I would revise my notes before my classes, which ran from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm. After class, I'd spend some time with friends before heading home. I often took a nap until 4:30 pm, after which I would go out to play with my siblings. We would play different games each evening, like football one day and cricket the next. These memories are very dear to me.</p>
            <p>I also fondly remember a family picnic where we visited the zoo. My mother packed delicious food, and my father took so many pictures that day. When I look at those photos, the memory feels so vivid, as if it happened just yesterday. My childhood memories are a source of happiness and make me smile whenever I feel low.</p>
