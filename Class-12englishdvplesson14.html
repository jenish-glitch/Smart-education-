                        <p class="answer">According to the author, it is the environment that shapes a man’s character. The birth of every child is the same. A child is not born a liar or a rapist. They are not born full of hatred or violence. No one is born with any less glory or goodness than us. Hence, heredity does not shape a man’s character. It is our surrounding environment that shapes our character.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Forgiveness is important in our life because it is the way of freeing ourselves from our past errors and moving forward into our future, unaffected by the mistakes we made in the past.</p>

                <strong class="question">a. Desmond Tutu once said, “Forgiving is not forgetting; it is actually remembering-remembering and not using your right to hit back. It’s a second chance for a new beginning.” Does this quotation apply to this text? Analyze.</strong>
                <p class="answer">The quotation by Desmond Tutu, "Forgiving is not forgetting; it is actually remembering-remembering and not using your right to hit back. It’s a second chance for a new beginning," is highly applicable to this text. Forgiveness is the process of releasing feelings of vengeance towards a person or group who harmed us, regardless of whether they deserve it. It does not deny the seriousness of an offense. In the text, the author, even while being willing to apologize, is still a victim of his father’s domestic violence. He remembers the pain his father inflicted on his mother. While he may have wanted to retaliate in his childhood, he later forgives his father by rationalizing that his father's rude behavior was a result of the mistreatment of black people by white people in South Africa. Therefore, his act of forgiveness is not an act of forgetting, but rather a conscious choice to remember the pain without using it as a justification for retaliation, thus allowing for a new beginning in his own life.</p>

                <strong class="question">b. The author interprets “I am sorry” as three hardest words to say. How does it apply to your life?</strong>
                <p class="answer">Committing mistakes is a part of human life, but accepting them and apologizing is often the hardest task. In the text, the author interprets “I am sorry” as the three hardest words to say. Empathy—the ability to put ourselves in another person's shoes—is something we need to develop to overcome this difficulty. It requires humility and the recognition that other people's feelings matter. By saying "I am sorry" sincerely, we validate them as human beings. In my own life, "I am sorry" are the hardest words to say when I hurt others. Instead of apologizing, I tend to distance myself from them until they come to me first. I am a sensitive and proud person who easily gets hurt and expects others to apologize to me. However, I often fail to realize how much my own misbehavior has affected them. Factors like pride, fear of being shamed, a lack of awareness, a sense of superiority, a gap in understanding, and the overwhelming emotion of guilt make it very difficult for me to say those three words.</p>

            <strong class="question">The author talks about dual education system based on race in South Africa in the second half of the twentieth century. We also have private schools and public schools in Nepal. What should be done to make education equal to all citizens of Nepal? Write a couple of paragraphs expressing your views.</strong>
            <p class="answer">Nepal has made significant progress in improving equity in education, but challenges remain, particularly with the dual system of private and public schools. Factors like income, geography, gender, language, and disability still contribute to unequal access and high dropout rates. To achieve equal education for all citizens, the government should focus on strengthening the public school system. This includes increasing funding for infrastructure, providing clean drinking water, and ensuring adequate nutrition for students. The quality of education in public schools needs to be improved through better teacher training, technological integration, and a standardized curriculum that meets modern demands. By enhancing the quality of public education, the disparity between public and private schools can be reduced, making quality education accessible to all, regardless of their socio-economic background.</p>
            <p class="answer">Furthermore, historical factors like the caste system, though legally abolished, continue to affect access to education for marginalized communities. The government’s initiatives, such as school enrollment campaigns and scholarships, are positive steps, but they need to be expanded and more effectively implemented. There should be a strong focus on addressing the root causes of poverty and social inequality that prevent children from attending school. Providing vocational training and skill-based education in public schools could also empower students and make them more employable, thereby breaking the cycle of poverty. Ultimately, creating a truly equal education system requires a holistic approach that not only improves schools but also addresses the broader societal issues of poverty, social exclusion, and gender inequality.</p>
