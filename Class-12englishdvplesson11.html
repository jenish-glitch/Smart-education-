                    <div class="question">a. Do you believe that walking helps us understand ourselves? Give reasons in support of your opinion.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Yes, I believe that walking helps us to understand ourselves. Walking provides the best of both worlds. It offers the physical benefits of exercise while also boosting your emotional well-being. It can help reduce anxiety, depression, and a negative mood. It can also boost self-esteem and reduce symptoms of social withdrawal. Walking also helps to clear our head and think creatively. It opens up a free flow of ideas and is a simple way to increase creativity and get physical activity at the same time. While walking we interact with our inner self, we evaluate ourselves, our works, our behavior. This makes us realize actually who we are. Understanding ourselves means self-realization which can happen when we are alone and submerged with natural world. Thus it's true that walking helps us to understand ourselves.</div>

                    <div class="answer">Hobbies are seen as markers of a balanced person who is adept at juggling personal and professional well-being. I have only one hobby. Yet, it consumes all my free time. I enjoy reading and have always been a voracious reader. Although I prefer reading fiction, I make a deliberate effort to read at least one non-fiction book in a couple of months. My first book was "Famous Five Go to Kirrin Island" at the age of ten. What I truly treasure about my hobby is its power to transport me to different locations whilst I'm still on my couch. It is a low budget travel option that I often take! Recently, I started attending book club meetings. It's a group of 15 individuals and we meet on the third Sunday, every month to discuss books that we have read in that month. It's wonderful how a few lines can have so many varied interpretations, and can give rise to a multitude of emotions and opinions. My hobby has made me develop analytical thinking and open-mindedness. Reading has also broadened my imagination across horizons. I wouldn't possibly trade it for anything else, ever!</div>

                    <div class="question">c. Many people turn their hobbies into careers. Is it good to turn one's hobby into a career?</div>
                    <div class="answer">Yes, it's true that many people turn their hobbies into careers. But what I think that is; a big decision of whether to turn a hobby into a career is a godsend for some lucky folks, but for other poor souls, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Whether you're looking to go freelance, set up a limited company or become a sole trader, making hobby turn into livelihood can be a messy business. Hobbies are really important for personal growth and enjoyment, and the last thing you want to do is turn a form of escapism from the hustle, bustle, and grind of everyday life into something stressful and pressurized. To sum up, if a person is truly passionate about his/her career, then he/she can easily turn their hobby into a career else it's going to be a great suffering.</div>
