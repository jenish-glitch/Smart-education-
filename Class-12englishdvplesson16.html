                    <li><strong class="question">a. How did Maxwell enter his office?</strong>
                        <p class="answer">Maxwell entered his office briskly with the young lady stenographer and greeted Pitcher by saying "Good Morning".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong class="question">b. Describe the physical appearance of the young lady.</strong>
                        <p class="answer">She was beautiful in a way that was decidedly un-stenographic. She forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour. She wore no chains, bracelets or lockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the gold-green wing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly radiant. Her eyes were dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine peachblow, her expression a happy one, tinged with reminiscence.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong class="question">c. What changes did Pitcher notice in the young lady?</strong>
                        <p class="answer">Pitcher noticed a difference in her ways this morning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where her desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office. Once she moved over by Maxwell's desk, near enough for him to be aware of her presence.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong class="question">d. What was Pitcher's reply to the young lady concerning a new stenographer?</strong>
                        <p class="answer">Pitcher's reply was that Maxwell had already told him to get another stenographer and had notified an agency a day before to send over a few samples that morning, and none of the candidates had arrived yet except her.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong class="question">e. What proposal did Maxwell make with Miss Leslie?</strong>
                        <p class="answer">Maxwell made a marriage proposal with Miss Leslie.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong class="question">f. How did she react to his proposal?</strong>
                        <p class="answer">She reacted very queerly when he proposed to her. At first, she seemed overcome with amazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about the broker's neck.</p>
