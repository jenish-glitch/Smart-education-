                <div class="question">a. Many innocent people lose their lives in ruthless attacks every year. What do you think the governments should do to protect their people from such attacks and make the world a safer place to live?</div>
                <div class="answer">It is true that many innocent people lose their lives in ruthless attacks every year. The government must be responsible for handling and controlling such situations. It should think seriously about the security of its citizens from such ruthless attacks. The things the government should do to protect their people from such attacks and make the world a safer place to live are as follows:
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">Every government should maintain stability in itself, among the leaders and the political parties.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Borders should have tighter restrictions.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Armed forces should be deployed at several places where there is a high risk of attack outbreaks.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Though peace treaties are being signed, they are often not followed accordingly. Every nation should work to maintain peace.</li>

                <div class="question">b. Revenge and violence are the integral parts of the history and civilization. They can't be ignored, only managed. Do you agree or not with this statement? Present your logic.</div>
                <div class="answer">Yes, I agree with the statement that revenge and violence are integral parts of history and civilization. Revenge is associated with hurt and damage, and violence is the use of physical force to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy. The cause of World War II is also due to the revenge from Germany. On June 28, 1919, when the Treaty of Versailles was signed, ending the war between Germany and the Allied Powers, it humiliated and blamed Germany for World War I and imposed heavy debt payments. Germany sought revenge for this in 1939, which started World War II. We have seen from our past that revenge and violence can lead to a miserable situation. Thus, they can't be ignored, but only managed.</div>

                <h3>A. Write a description of an event that you have recently witnessed.</h3>
                <div class="answer">Recently I witnessed a very special celestial event known as the full lunar eclipse. It was special because astronomers declared it to be the longest lunar eclipse of this century, which took place on July 27. It was difficult for me because I had to stay awake until late at night to watch this lunar eclipse. Finally, the eclipse started at 11:30 pm and ended at 1 a.m. I was accompanied by a few friends who chose to witness this lunar eclipse. We kept looking up in the sky for one and a half hours, which was a bit difficult but rewarding in the end.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>B. Write an essay on "An Unforgettable Event in my Life' in about 500 words.</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>It is true that if we have joys in our life, we have sorrows too. Like all others, I cannot be an exception. I still remember the day when I felt that there is no joy in the world but sorrow.</p>
                    <p>I was enjoying the vacations after my tenth-class board examinations. My best friend in the neighborhood, Alisha, was staying with me. Her parents had gone to Kathmandu where her grandfather was to undergo a major operation. My parents and I did our best to keep her happy and away from missing her parents. For us, it was playtime all through the day.</p>
                    <p>One evening as we were playing our little brain game, her parents called and said her grandfather's operation was successful and her parents were to return the next day by plane. On reading it, Alisha was overjoyed and I joined her in her moment of happiness.</p>
                    <p>That night Alisha did not sleep. She counted the hours until the early morning. We dressed hurriedly and my father took us to the airport. On reaching there, we sensed something was wrong. The Yeti Airlines flight from Kathmandu had crashed while landing. Fire tenders and ambulances were on the run. Our hearts sank. Alisha fainted from shock. My father hired a taxi and sent us back home.</p>
                    <p>We waited with throbbing hearts for my father to return with her safe and sound parents. My mother sent for a doctor as Alisha's condition became worse. I sat by her side silently wishing for a happy turn. My father returned only to say that there was no sign of her parents though their names were mentioned in the airline's passenger list. Alisha was hysterical and it became difficult to control her.</p>
                    <p>She said that she wanted to go to her home. I decided to go with her while my mother would soon follow. Once out on the street, she ran towards her home. I saw a speeding car and shouted at her to stop. She didn't. The car didn't stop and sped away leaving her lying on the road badly hurt.</p>
                    <p>We immediately took her to a nearby hospital. The doctors who examined her said she may recover gradually but did not confirm her recovery. She was placed in the intensive care unit.</p>
                    <p>I returned home with my parents. The moment we entered the room, the telephone rang. It was a call from the hospital to inform us that Alisha was no more. I felt numb and tears welled up in my eyes. I still refused to believe what I heard was true.</p>
                    <p>Again, the telephone rang and it was from Alisha's parents to inform us that they had missed their flight due to some car trouble on their way to the airport. The news of Alisha's parents being alive did not touch my heart. Alisha's parents were shocked to hear about their daughter's death when they came home the next day. But nothing could be done. Even today when I remember the incident, every moment of that day flashes through my eyes and I begin to cry, "Alisha, why did you have to die? I have lost a good friend in you."</p>

                    <p>What are we seeing here? One very real possibility is that these are the educational consequences <strong>of</strong> the differences <strong>in</strong> parenting styles that we talked about <strong>in</strong> the Chris Langan chapter. Think back <strong>to</strong> Alex Williams, the nine-year-old whom Annette Lareau studied. His parents believe <strong>in</strong> connected cultivation. He gets taken <strong>to</strong> museums and gets enrolled <strong>in</strong> special programs and goes <strong>to</strong> summer camp, where he takes classes. When he's bored <strong>at</strong> home, there are plenty <strong>of</strong> books to read, and his parents see it as their responsibility to keep him actively engaged <strong>in</strong> the world <strong>for</strong> him. It's hard to see how Alex would get better <strong>at</strong> reading and math <strong>in</strong> the summer.</p>
