                    <div class="question">a. Do you agree that 'the couples, who laugh together, stay together?' Is it important for married couples to have the same sense of humour? Why?</div>
                    <div class="answer">Yes, I agree with the statement that "the couples, who laugh together, stay together." A sense of humour is an attractive trait. There is abundant cross cultural evidence that shows that being funny makes you more desirable as a mate. Simply having a funny bond doesn't mean you two are the perfect match – apparently being able to laugh at the same things makes your partnership even stronger. A good sense of humour makes a person more attractive. Laughter is called the best medicine not without a reason, and this holds true for couples who might be going through stressful times. Studies have proved time and again how laughter helps release feel-good hormones that help to relieve stress. So, it's important for married couples to share good laughter and have the same sense of humour whenever they find themselves bogged down by trouble.</div>

                    <div class="question">b. Some people believe that sometimes crying is good for health. Do you believe it? Give your reasons.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Crying is a natural response humans have to a range of emotions, including sadness, grief, joy, and frustration. Yes I believe that crying is good for health. Medical benefits of crying have been known as far back as the Classical era. Thinkers and physicians of ancient Greece and Rome posited that tears work like a purgative, draining off and purifying us. Today's psychological thought largely concurs, emphasizing the role of crying as a mechanism that allows us to release stress and emotional pain. When we cry, we let out tons of emotions that allow our body and mind to reboot after you release all those emotions. Crying is particularly important during periods of grieving. It may even help to process and accept the loss of a loved one. People often report feeling better after they cry. That could be because crying forces us to pay attention to what triggered us and work through our emotions and thoughts. Crying might also help in understanding what's important to us, especially if we cry over something that upset us unexpectedly. By this we can say that crying is an essential form of relief and hence it is good for health too.</div>

                    <h4>Charlie Chaplin</h4>
                    <p>Charlie Chaplin was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the silent era. He is mostly famous for his screen persona "the tramp". Born on April 16, 1889 in London, Chaplin is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. He had been a productive and creative film maker for about 75 years before he died in 1977.</p>
                    <p>Chaplin suffered from poverty and hardship in his childhood. He was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. His mother struggled financially when his father was absent. When he was 14, his mother was sent to a mental asylum.</p>
                    <p>Chaplin's first performances were at music halls as a stage actor and comedian at the age of 19. He went to the USA where he was scouted for the film industry, and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage, and continued to hone his craft. By 1918, he was one of the best known figures in the film industry.</p>
                    <p>Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture.</p>
