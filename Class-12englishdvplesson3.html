            <div class="question">e. State the contribution of Roberto Mancini to the Italian football.</div>
            <div class="answer">Less than four years ago, Italy was at its lowest point in football history, having failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades. Under Roberto Mancini, they are now the best team in Europe with a national record of 34 games unbeaten. Mancini brought great confidence to the Italian football team and guided them to victory in the Euro 2020.</div>

        <div class="question-answer">
            <div class="question">f. How does the Euro Cup final 2020 remind the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals?</div>
            <div class="answer">The Euro Cup Final 2020 reminds the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals because, similar to the 2018 match against Croatia, England also scored early against Italy but then spent most of the game chasing its opponent's midfield before losing in extra time.</div>
        </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
        <h3>a. "Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind and start over again." Does this apply to the Italian football team when we analyse their performance from their failure to qualify for the World Cup Football to their victory in the European Championship in these four years?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Yes, the statement "Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind and start over again" perfectly applies to the Italian football team. Following their failure to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years, the Italian team, under Roberto Mancini, underwent a radical transformation. They didn't dwell on their failure but used it as a catalyst for change and improvement. Mancini instilled a new culture of confidence, strategy, and organization. This enabled them to go on a national record of 34 games unbeaten and ultimately win the Euro 2020. Their journey is a testament to the power of learning from past failures and approaching every new match as a fresh opportunity to succeed.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>b. When a team plays in a home ground, it gets a huge support from the audience in the stadium. Does this support them to win the match or the players may feel pressure to win and thus lose? What do you think?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Playing on home ground can have a dual effect on a team. On one hand, the massive support from home fans can provide a significant psychological and confidence boost, often referred to as the "home ground advantage." This can lead to better performance, as players feel more encouraged and motivated. The familiarity with the playing conditions, weather, and pitch also gives the home team a tactical edge.</p>
            <p>However, this support can also create immense pressure. The expectation to perform well and not disappoint the home crowd can be overwhelming for some players. In the case of the Euro Cup 2020 final, England had not won a major tournament since 1966. This long wait created a burden of expectation, and the pressure from the home crowd at Wembley might have contributed to the team's lack of faith and eventual loss in the penalty shootout. Therefore, while home ground support can be a powerful tool for victory, it can also lead to increased pressure, which may cause players to falter and lose a match.</p>

        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <h3>A. Punctuate the following passage with appropriate punctuation marks.</h3>
        <div class="punctuation-passage">
            A lot of people try to get away from home for a few days each year for a holiday. There are lots of things to choose from, and where you go depends on how much money you've got to spend. Ideas for holidays include relaxing on a beach, exploring cities, and skiing. One man wanted to go to Australia but thought he'd never have enough money to get there. He'd go to his brother's caravan at the seaside instead. A young woman wanted to go clubbing in Ibiza as she'd heard it was a lot of fun.
