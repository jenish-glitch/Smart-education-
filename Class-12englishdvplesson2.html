        <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
        <h3>a. What changes have started to occur in Nepali families in recent days? What impacts will they bring on the society? Discuss.</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>In the 21st century, Nepali families are gradually shifting from traditional to modern cultural norms. People are increasingly prioritizing personal happiness and are opting for nuclear families. While this offers greater happiness and individual satisfaction, it has also led to a rapid increase in divorce rates due to misunderstandings. Both men and women are now sharing household roles and have equal rights within the family. This has led to a greater understanding among family members who can share their ideas and feelings freely.</p>
            <p>There is also a decline in early, arranged marriages, with more individuals choosing their own partners. This suggests a shift in marital decision-making processes, where personal choice is becoming more important than family agreements. These changes will bring both positive and negative impacts on society. While they promote equality and individual happiness, they may also strain traditional family bonds and values.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>b. We see many elderly people in the elderly homes these days in Nepal. Some of them are abandoned while others live there willingly. Do you think Nepali people are deviating from their traditional culture? Give reasons.</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>The increasing number of elderly people in nursing homes in Nepal indicates a deviation from traditional culture. Historically, the joint family system was dominant, with families sharing the responsibility of caring for their elders, providing emotional, psychological, and economic support, and giving them respect. This system was the socio-economic backbone of Nepalese society.</p>
            <p>However, with modernization and new lifestyles, the traditional joint family is breaking down into nuclear families. This shift in family structure and values often compels the elderly to live alone or move to institutions. Reasons for this include the misbehavior of children, financial crises, a feeling of ignorance, and a lack of emotional support. Some elderly people willingly choose to live in these homes, viewing them as a better alternative for a problem-free life.</p>
            <p>The traditional extended family had its advantages, such as a strong sense of community, cultural protection, and shared responsibilities, but also disadvantages like less privacy and potential for suppressed personality development. The modern nuclear family offers greater understanding, cooperation, and freedom for its members but can lead to a lack of security, proper care for the young and old, and a disconnect from traditional norms. While both family structures have their pros and cons, the rise of elderly homes clearly shows that Nepalese society is moving away from its traditional, integrated family system.</p>
